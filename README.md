This anaylize a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.


Used Pandas to import the data from epa-sea-level.csv.
Used matplotlib to create a scatter plot using the "Year" column as the x-axis and the "CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level" column as the y-axix.
Used the linregress function from scipy.stats to get the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit. Plot the line of best fit over the top of the scatter plot.
Ploted a new line of best fit just using the data from year 2000 through the most recent year in the dataset. 

Development
For development,used main.py to test functions.
